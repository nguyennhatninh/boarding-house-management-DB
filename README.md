1. List all boarding houses along with their owners (lessors) and their verification status. Sort the boarding houses by price in descending order.

way1: 
select * from boarding_houses 
where boarding_houses.lessor_id in 
( select lessors.id from lessors where verify_ownership = true )
order by boarding_houses.price desc

way2:
select * from boarding_houses 
where exists
( select lessors.id from lessors where lessors.verify_ownership = true 
and boarding_houses.lessor_id = lessors.id )
order by boarding_houses.price desc

way3: 
select * from boarding_houses 
join lessors on boarding_houses.lessor_id = lessors.id 
where lessors.verify_ownership = true
order by boarding_houses.price desc

2. Find the renter who has the highest total number of contracts and list the details of their contracts (including the boarding house and lessor information).
